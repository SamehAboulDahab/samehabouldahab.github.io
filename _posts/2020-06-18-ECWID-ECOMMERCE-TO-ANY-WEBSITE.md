<div><b><a href="http://open.ecwid.com/GetECWID" target="_blank">Ecwid </a></b>is a tool for building your own online store. It’s a ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) tool, meaning that you don’t own the software, but pay a monthly fee to use it. Much like other e-commerce platforms, <b><a href="http://open.ecwid.com/GetECWID" target="_blank">Ecwid </a></b>allows you to set up ‘catalogs’ of products, and add photos, pricing, weight, etc. for each. You can define shipping rates, accept credit card payments with no charges for using a third-party payment gateway like Sage, Stripe, 2Checkout, Authorize.Net, and many others – all the key stuff that you’d expect to be able to do using an e-commerce solution.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><u>The paid plans</u></b></div><div><b><u><br /></u></b></div><div>In terms of the paid plans, the pricing structure is as follows:</div><div><br /></div><div>$15 per month - the 'Ecwid Venture' plan — this allows you to sell up to 100 products;</div><div>$35 per month - the 'Ecwid Business' plan — this allows you to sell up to 2500;</div><div>$99 per month - the 'Ecwid Unlimited' plan — this allows you to sell an unlimited number of products.</div><div><br /></div><div>With all <a href="http://open.ecwid.com/GetECWID" target="_blank">Ecwid </a>plans, you can either embed your products on another site or create a basic standalone site, using Ecwid’s ‘Instant Site’ feature. In the case paying yearly gives you a 16.6% discount.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://open.ecwid.com/GetECWID" target="_blank"><b>Ecwid </b></a>is a cost-effective, powerful way to add e-commerce functionality to an existing site, or to place an online store on a Facebook page or other social media presence. It deserves particular praise for the way it handles GDPR cookie consent and multi-currency selling. There is, however, a bit of room for improvement when it comes to SEO.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
